# Angular2-Getting Started
* ["Angular 2: Getting Started"](http://bit.ly/Angular2-GettingStarted) course by Deborah Kurata on Pluralsight.
* [Original GitHub Repo](https://github.com/DeborahK/Angular2-GettingStarted) for sample code 

1) Open a command prompt in the project's root directory (APM)

2) Type: `npm install`
    This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file.
    
3) Type: `npm start`
    This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes. 
    It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application.

NOTE: The installation was tested using node v6.5.0 and npm 3.10.6.
